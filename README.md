        "source": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=15552",
        "rating": "7.94"
}

# Support
This project is completely free to use and it's solely maintained by me, from front-end to back-end to frequent database updates, which takes a lot of my time. That is also the reason I stopped maintaining it for a long time. So to keep the API free forever, please consider donating. That would be greatly appreciated.
